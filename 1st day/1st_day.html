            <h1><em>GETTING STARTED</em></h1>
            <h3><em>What is HTML?</em></h3>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
                It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
                you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing
                tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
                following line of text:
                <p class="highred">This is a paragraph</p>
            </p>

            <h1><em>ANATOMY OF HTML TAGS</em></h1>
            every html tag consists of <br>
            {opening tag} content {closing tag}

            <h1><em>NESTING TAGS</em></h1>
            html elements can be placed in other elements for example
            <p class="highred">this is <strong>this is a nested one</strong> a tag</p>

            <h1><em>VOID TAGS</em></h1>
            Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements
            consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements
            are called void elements. For example, the <strong class="highred">[img]</strong> element embeds an image file onto a page:
            <img src="./assets/img/pngegg.png" alt="Calighraphied infinity" width="50%">

            <h1><em>ATTRIBUTES</em></h1>
            Elements can also have attributes.
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
            <strong class="highred" width="">This contains an attribute</strong> 

            <h1><em>BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES</em></h1>
            Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes. 
            When a boolean attribute is written without a value, or with any value, even like "false", the boolean attribute is always 
            set to true. <br>
            <input type="text" disabled="disabled" />

            <p><em>single and double quotes</em></p>

            In html there consists of a few dozen tags that are text related most would be used and veiwed over the course of time <br>
            <p class="highred">this is a paragraph probably the most used text tag</p>
            <em class="highred">this is an emphasis tag</em> <br><br>
            <strong class="highred">this is a bold tag</strong> <br><br>

            <h2><em>And lists</em></h2>
            this consists of ordered and unordered lists

            <h1><em>ADVANCED TEXT FORMATTING</em></h1>
            <h3><em>DESCRIPTION LISTS</em></h3>
            The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, 
            such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers
            <dl>

            <h3><em>Multiple descriptions for one term</em></h3>
            Note that it is permitted to have a single term with multiple descriptions
            <dl>
                <dt>aside</dt>
                <dd>
                  In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
                  humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
                  additional background information.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                  In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but
                  doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby
                  (often in a box off to the side.)
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <h3><em>BLOCKQUOTES</em></h3>
            If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, 
            you should wrap it inside a blockquote element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside 
            a cite attribute.
            <p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
            <blockquote
            cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
            <p>
                The <stron>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</stron> (or
                <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is
                an extended quotation.
            </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3><em>Quotation</em></h3>
            Inline quotations work in exactly the same way as blockquote, except that they use the 'q' element
            <p>
                The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
                <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">
                  intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.
                </q>
            </p>

    HTML DEBUGGING
    Syntax errors: These are spelling or punctuation errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust error 
    shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages 
    mean.
    Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that 
    the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the 
    source of the error.

    <p>What causes errors in HTML?
    <ul>
    <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
        then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

    <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
        for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong>
        what is this?</em>

    <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
        look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla
        homepage</a>
    </ul>
